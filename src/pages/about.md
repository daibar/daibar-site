Hey there! ðŸ‘‹


I'm Danny Aibar, a passionate software engineer and web developer with a background in energy and IoT devices.  While I'm currently based in the San Diego area I consider myself a certified kook from New York City who loves all things water sports (surfing/kayaking), languages and playing music.  When I'm not spending my free time with my wife and two children, you will likely find me at my computer wishing I was in the water or practicing some Van Halen riffs!


I'm a strong believer in work that pushes forward tech for social justice, climate change mitigation and digital privacy.  What we work on matters and I believe where and the people we work with do too. ðŸ˜ƒ
