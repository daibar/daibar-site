Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
<br/>
<br/>
I'm Danny Aibar, a passionate software engineer and web developer with a background in energy and IoT devices.  While I'm currently based in the San Diego area I consider myself a certified surfer poser originally from New York City who loves all things water sports, languages and playing music.  When I'm not spending my free time with my wife and two children, you'll likely find me at my computer wishing I was in the water or practicing some Van Halen riffs!

<br/>
I'm a strong believer in work that pushes technology forward for social justice, climate change mitigation and digital privacy.  What we work on matters and the people we work with do too. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ¤™
